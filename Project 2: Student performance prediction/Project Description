This project analyzes student performance data to predict whether students will pass or fail based on various academic and demographic features. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training with a Decision Tree classifier, and visualization of key insights.

**Key Steps:**

1. Data Preparation:
Combined datasets for Math (student-mat.csv) and Portuguese (student-por.csv) subjects
Created a binary pass target variable (1 if final grade â‰¥ 10, 0 otherwise)
Removed intermediate grade columns (G1, G2, G3) to simulate real-world prediction

2. Feature Engineering:
Encoded all categorical variables using Label Encoding
Identified 30+ features including study time, school attendance, alcohol consumption, and family factors

3. Model Training:
Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier with max_depth=5
Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets
Achieved 71.3% accuracy on test data

4. Evaluation Metrics:
Classification report:
--Precision: 75% (pass), 50% (fail)
--Recall: 91% (pass), 23% (fail)
--Confusion matrix visualization


*Key Visualizations:*
Pass Rate by Study Time: Students studying 3-4 hours had 20-30% higher pass rates
School/Gender Analysis: Urban school students outperformed rural peers, with females showing higher pass rates
Confusion matrix showing model prediction patterns


**Technical Approach:**
Algorithms: Decision Tree (scikit-learn)
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Preprocessing: Label Encoding for categorical variables
Evaluation: Accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix


Model outputs:
Trained classifier
Evaluation metrics
Visualizations in PNG format


Insights:
Study time has strong correlation with pass rates
Model better at identifying passing students (91% recall) than failing students (23% recall)
School type and gender significantly impact outcomes
