This project analyzes standardized test data from NYC public schools to identify top-performing institutions in math. The analysis focuses on understanding performance distribution across boroughs and highlighting schools with exceptional math scores.

*Key Features:*
Cleaned and standardized education dataset (handling missing values, column normalization)
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover performance patterns
Identified top 10 schools by math proficiency
Visualized borough-level performance differences
Analyzed distribution of math scores across all schools

**Technical Approach:**

1. Data Preparation:
Imported pandas/numpy for data manipulation
Standardized column names (lowercase, underscore-separated)

2. Handled missing values:
Dropped rows with missing math scores
Filled missing test percentage values with median

3. Exploratory Analysis:
Generated descriptive statistics (mean, min/max, percentiles)
Calculated borough-level math performance averages
Identified top 10 schools by math scores

4. Data Visualization:
Created bar plots showing borough performance comparisons
Built histograms to visualize math score distributions
Utilized Seaborn/Matplotlib for professional visualizations

**Key Findings:**
Staten Island schools showed highest average math performance
Specialized STEM schools dominated the top 10 rankings
Math scores followed a roughly normal distribution with some high-performing outliers

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Statistical analysis
Data visualization
Pandas/Numpy/Seaborn/Matplotlib proficiency
Educational data interpretation
