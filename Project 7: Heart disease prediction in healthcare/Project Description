This project analyzes healthcare data to predict heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. It focuses on preprocessing a real-world dataset, exploring feature correlations, training predictive models (Logistic Regression and Decision Trees), and evaluating model performance to identify key risk factors for heart disease.

**Key Steps:**

1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection:
Imported UCI Heart Disease dataset (heart_disease_uci.csv)
Performed initial data exploration:
--Shape: 920 rows Ã— 16 features
--Displayed first 5 rows
--Generated descriptive statistics
--Identified missing values (e.g., 66% missing in thal)

2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:
Removed irrelevant columns (id)
Created binary target variable (target = 1 if heart disease present)
Handled missing values:
--Replaced placeholder values (e.g., 4/5/9 in ca) with NaN
--Imputed ca with median, thal with mode
Addressed outliers using IQR method (capped values in trestbps, chol, thalch)
Converted categorical features to category dtype
Removed duplicate rows (2 instances)

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized target distribution (55.3% heart disease cases)
Generated correlation matrix and heatmap
Identified top correlations with target:
--thalch (-0.39), exang (0.34), oldpeak (0.31)

4. Feature Engineering:
Created binary target from original num column
Processed special placeholder values in categorical features

5. Technical Highlights:
Built data processing pipeline with SimpleImputer and StandardScaler
Utilized scikit-learn for model training
Implemented visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Computed evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)


**Skills Demonstrated:**
Data Preprocessing: Missing value imputation, outlier handling, categorical encoding
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, pipeline construction
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Data Visualization: Correlation heatmaps, target distribution plots
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics, correlation studies


**Key Insights:**
Key risk factors identified: Exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression (oldpeak)
Dataset imbalance: 55.3% positive heart disease cases
Strong negative correlation: Max heart rate (thalch) vs heart disease
Critical preprocessing step: 66% missing values in thal required mode imputation
