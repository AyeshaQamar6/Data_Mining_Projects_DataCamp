This project performs customer segmentation for a retail business using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics to enable targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Steps:**

1. Data Loading and Inspection
Imported essential libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning
Loaded the mall customers dataset containing: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed distributions of key features:
--Age distribution shows most customers are between 30-40 years
--Annual income peaks at $60k-80k
--Spending scores follow a normal distribution
Visualized categorical distribution of gender

3. Data Preprocessing
Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize:
--Annual Income
--Spending Score
Ensured features were on comparable scales for clustering

4. K-Means Clustering:
Determined optimal cluster count (k=5) using the Elbow Method
Implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers into groups
Identified distinct customer segments:
--High-income, low-spending
--High-income, high-spending
--Moderate-income, moderate-spending
--Low-income, high-spending
--Low-income, low-spending

5. Visualization:
Created scatter plots showing clusters in 2D space (Income vs Spending Score)
Visualized cluster centroids to understand segment characteristics
Generated cluster profile summaries


**Key Findings:**
Identified 5 distinct customer segments with unique purchasing patterns
High-income customers show polarized spending behavior (either high or low)
Younger customers tend to have higher spending scores
Gender distribution is relatively balanced across segments


**Skills Demonstrated:**
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
K-Means clustering implementation
Hyperparameter tuning using the Elbow Method
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Customer segmentation strategy development


**Business Applications:**
The segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies:
--Target high-spending customers with premium offers
--Develop budget-friendly options for price-sensitive segments
--Create loyalty programs for moderate spenders
--Design age-specific promotions based on segment characteristics
